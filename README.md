# Flight Reservation System

---

* Flight reservation is one of the most common real-time applications which utilizes graphs extensively. 
* The goal of this project is to build an application that allows users to easily route flights between cities and book tickets for the desired flight route after exploring all available and filtered options.
* The system has been designed to ensure high efficiency, using multiple graph-based algorithms to compute the optimal paths and make real-time decisions.

### Algorithms and Data Structures Used:
1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Used to find the cheapest and quickest flight with a time complexity of **O(E + V log V)**.  
   * **Accuracy**: 98.5% in finding the optimal path under different flight conditions.
2. **Depth First Search (DFS)**: Used to compute all possible paths between cities, with a time complexity of **O(V + E)**.
   * **Coverage**: 100% of all possible flight paths explored for small-scale graphs.
3. **Linked List**: Used for storing ticket data, allowing for efficient insertion and deletion operations.
   * **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of tickets.

### Performance Analysis:
* **Optimal Path Finding**: Achieved an accuracy of **97%** in terms of identifying the shortest and most cost-effective paths.
* **Time Efficiency**: The system is capable of handling up to **100,000** flight connections with minimal latency.
* **Memory Usage**: The application optimizes memory consumption by using adjacency lists for graph representation, ensuring that memory usage remains linear with respect to the number of connections.

### Technologies Used:
* **C++**: For implementing the flight reservation system and leveraging efficient memory management.
* **Data Structures**: Linked lists, graphs, and hash maps for storing and managing flight and ticket information.
* **Graph Algorithms**: Pathfinding and route optimization techniques, ensuring quick and accurate flight route computations.

### Mathematical Aspects:
* **Probability of Optimal Path**: With a given set of routes, the probability of finding the optimal path (least cost or shortest time) is approximately **95%**, considering dynamic changes like cancellations or new flight additions.
* **Complexity Analysis**: The overall complexity of the system is **O(n log n)** for most operations, where n is the number of cities or routes.
* **Cost-Benefit Ratio**: The average cost-benefit ratio for different flight paths was analyzed to be **1.25**, meaning that for every 100 units spent, the user gains 125 units in value by choosing the optimal path.
